The [Roving Networks RN-41](http://www.rovingnetworks.com/products/RN41) was
chosen to implement the Bluetooth interface for the VI because:

* it supports the Serial Port Profile (SPP) configuration
* it doesn't require implementing a Host/Controller Interface (HCI), keeping the
  MCU code simple
  - the stack is on the RN-41

The only major design impact of the RN-41 is that it requires a large "keepout"
area near the antenna of the module. In this area, there should be a minimal
amount of traces or copper blocking the radio signal. The [RN-41
Datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Wireless/Bluetooth/Bluetooth-RN-41-DS.pdf)
illustrates the suggested keepout zone on page 9. Otherwise, the RN-41 is
controlled with a serial UART bus with similar bitrates to the CAN data (230kbps
- 1Mbps).

In our testing we discovered that hardware flow control is necessary to fully
saturate the bluetooth link. The firmware on the RN-41 [does not respond
well](http://christopherpeplin.com/2013/07/26/uart-hardware-flow-control/) to
buffer overruns - if data is written to the RN-41 faster than it can be sent
over the bluetooth link, the module will eventually overflow and reset without
warning. Adding the RTS and CTS lines to UART1 on the LPC1769 fixed this problem
- the RN-41 will inform the MCU host when it's buffer is full.

The tradeoff of a simplified Bluetooth module is that the implementation details
of the SPP profile limit the throughput of the bluetooth link. While the
underlying Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) bluetooth link can technically operate at
3Mbps, the asynchronous nature of SPP limits the RN-41 to 240kbps in slave mode.
In our testing, the RN-41 only hit this speed for brief peak bursts. The
sustained average speed was 202kbps. Future designs may consider using a more
complicated Bluetooth chipset with an HCI interface implemented on the MCU for
greater throughput. An example of a test run:

* Average rate: 25.282 KB/s
* Maximum speed: 30.185 KB/s
* Minimum speed: 14.718 KB/s
