If you want to take this design into the physical world, the major components
you need to build are:

* Manufacture the PCB, e.g. with a company like [OSH Park](http://oshpark.com/)
* Manufacture the enclosure, e.g. with your own [3D
  printer](https://store.makerbot.com/3d-printers) (you may find one at your
  local [TechShop][]), a rapid prototyping shop like
  [Fathom](http://studiofathom.com/) or an injection molding service like
  [Protomold](http://www.protomold.com/).
* Assemble the components onto the PCB - there are surface mount components that
  will reuquire a reflow oven, so you can't hand solder this. Again, check out
  your local [TechShop][] (Note: currently all TechShops are close but look for similar shops such as [ProtoHaven][]) or a prototyping firm like [SF
  Circuits](http://www.sfcircuits.com/).
